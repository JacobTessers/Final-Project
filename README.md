The cloud Jupyter notebook for this project can be viewed [here](https://deepnote.com/project/Final-Project-8d15e87d-b710-4fff-80ef-ff0e4cb338ff/%2Fproject_function_exploration.ipynb).

## Project Rationale
Project Function's participation appears to be lacking from online students. Is there a correlation between online and in-person learning?

## Tech Stack

- Google Sheets (the incoming data was obtained in `.xlsx` format)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Processes Used
-Pulling .csv files and pushing to Deepnote.
-Data cleaning
-Data Exploration
-Data Visualization

## Coding Standards
-Python


## Project Goals
- Explore the activites on Project Functionâ€™s online platform.
- See if students using the online platform perform better overall.
- Recommend improvements on the ways data is recorded.
- Identify patterns in student behavior using a small data sample.

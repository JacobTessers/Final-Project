- [Project Function](https://projectfunction.io/) has since 2018 taught over 76 courses in Web Development, Design with Unity and general coding.
- User friendly to beginner and experienced tech learners. 
- Courses free of charge.
- Large focus on helping minorities succeed in tech.

The cloud Jupyter notebook for this project can be viewed [here](https://deepnote.com/project/Final-Project-8d15e87d-b710-4fff-80ef-ff0e4cb338ff/%2Fproject_function_exploration.ipynb).

## Project Rationale
Project Function's participation appears to be lacking from online students. Is there a correlation between online and in-person learning?

## Tech Stack
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)

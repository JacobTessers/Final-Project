## Final Project
The data pulled for this project was provided by Daryl at Project Function, a learning platform with the goal of providing free courses on Web Developement, Web Design, and User experience to any and all interested people. Their website can be viewed [here](https://projectfunction.io/en-US/about).

## Project Rationale
Project Function's participation appears to be lacking from online students. Is there a correlation between online and in-person learning?

Data Analysis of ProjectFunction

by Jacob Tessers

---

## Who I Am

- Originally from Southern California, I have lived in Utah for the past 17 years. 
- I am married with no children.
- Currently working full-time while finishing this program.
- I am an avid gamer, though I also enjoy movies and learning.
- I hope to establish myself as a data analyst and further my learning to become a data scientist at some point down the line.

## Technical Abilities

- Some experience with Python before this course, which helped tremendously.
- Completed courses with DataCamp and Coursera.
- Salesforce, particularly Tableau
- SQL
- Github

---


## The Client

-  Daryl Cecile (software developer at Capital One) is one of the founders of Project Function.
-  Rizwana Khan is the other founder, but I didn't meet her.
- [Project Function](https://projectfunction.io/) has since 2018 taught over 95 sessions in Web Development, Design with Unity and general coding.
- User friendly to beginner and experienced tech learners. 
- Sessions are free of charge.
- Large focus on helping minorities succeed in tech.

## Coming up with Project Function

---

### Project Goals

- Explore the activites on Project Functionâ€™s online platform.
- See if students using the online platform perform better overall.
- Recommend improvements on the ways data is recorded.
- Identify patterns in student behavior using a small data sample.

---

## Project Challenges

- Data came from a data warehouse and was messy.
- There were many irrelevant tables.
- There was duplicated data.
- Some data was incomplete.
- There was a lot of overall missing data as we were given a small sample.

##### Small Snapshot of Activity Log

---

## The Data

The data provided includes 89 users with hundreds of individual records for these students.

---

### Tech Stack

- Google Sheets - Data came in Excel format
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

---

### Data Journey

- Which tables from the google sheet were relevant?
- Download as .csv.
- Push to Deepnote to query the data.

---


### Data Cleaning

- Repetivtive steps
- Had to use duplicated and drop_duplicates methods a lot

#### Dropping Unnecessary Columns

---

### Data Exploration

---



```python=
activity_log['activity'].unique()
```

---

### Renaming the Activity Column

As there were many unique activites, with several very similar, I added a column to group activites by an Overview, e.g., "Accessed a Session" for all entries that related to accessing different sessions. here is a small sample of how I used `.apply()` to do that.

```python=
activity_log['activity'].apply(
    lambda x: "Accessed a Session" if "Session" in x else x)
```

### Personalizing the Data

By further analysis and incorporation of users on the platform, I was able to see how much involvement a particular user had, distinguishing between Online and In-Person participation.

---

### Conclusion

- Data in a format makes it much easier to understand. 
- We can see that while more learners happened to be online and while they did participate, in-person learners happened to overall participate more.
- Factors could include:
    Work schedules, 
    Life or Sickness,
    Fluctuation of Interest

---

### Suggestions

- Log out data as timestamps in Activity log.
- Enforce uniqueness contraints on assignment submissions to overwrite duplicate submissions.
- Larger dataset to explore individual student behaviors.
